# Kubernetes Manifests

## Base

This directory contains the base Kubernetes manifests for the application.
These should usually not differ between environments.

## Example

This directory contains an example of how to use the base manifests to deploy
the application to a specific environment.

While the defaults should work for most environments, you may need to modify these manifests to suit your needs.
